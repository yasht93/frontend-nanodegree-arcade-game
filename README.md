Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

This is a simple arcade game called **Frogger**.
In order to run the game please open the file index.html in your browser.

##Objective of the game:
The player must cross the path to reach the river in order to win the game. The moving bugs are the enemies hitting to which the player dies and starts from the beginning.

##Steps for playing the game:
- Use the ` _Up_ `, ` _Down_ `, ` _Left_ ` and ` _Right_ ` keys to move the player in the game in the corresponding direction.
- Beware of the bugs and use the direction keys to dodge the player from hitting them.
